# Actors

[gateway] the IoT gateway running in the local network.

[cloud] is the registration+dns+tunnel combo.

[app] is a 3rd party web application that will access [gateway] on behalf of the end user.

[browser] is the user's web browser.

# Setup

1. [gateway <-> browser] Start the server on HTTP and load the setup UI at http://localhost:8080
2. [gateway <-> cloud] Find an available DNS name, receive the API token using `/subscribe`.
3. [gateway <-> cloud] Run the LE DNS challenge, use `/dnsconfig`, retrieve the certificates, restart the server on HTTPS.
4. [gateway <-> browser] Create the admin account with an email address, verify email using `/setemail`.
5. [gateway <-> cloud] Periodically ping the cloud service using `/ping`.

# Email verification

1. The admin UI calls `/setemail`, which triggers the sending of a verification email.
2. When the user clicks on the link from the email, this validates the email as being associated with the gateway.
3. It is possible to check if an email is setup by calling the `/info` endpoint.

# Domain Reclamation

1. [gateway <-> browser] Start the server on HTTP and load the setup UI at http://localhost:8080
2. [gateway <-> cloud] User chooses a DNS name already in use (determined via `/subscribe`) and is given the option to reclaim.
3. [gateway <-> cloud] Gateway calls `/reclaim`. A random reclamation token is generated and emailed to the registered email address.
4. [gateway <-> browser] User enters the reclamation token.
5. [gateway <-> cloud] Gateway again calls `/subscribe` with the reclamation token, receives and API token.
6. [gateway <-> cloud] Run the LE DNS challenge, use `/dnsconfig`, retrieve the certificates, restart the server on HTTPS.
7. [gateway <-> browser] Create the admin account with an email address, verify email using `/setemail`.
8. [gateway <-> cloud] Periodically ping the cloud service using `/ping`.
